The opening ceremony at the Olympic Games has become a major entertainment spectacle, costing many millions of dollars to stage. It has come a long way since the first opening 
ceremonies held during the 1908 Olympic Games in London, where for the first time, athletes marched into the stadium behind their nations' flags.
The opening ceremonies at the olympic games are an extraordinary and intricately choreographed extravaganza, featuring an amazing explosion of colour and music, which allow the host 
nation scope to showcase its uniqueness, while adhering to various protocols that have evolved since the first modern olympic games were held in athens in 1896.
The Opening Ceremony attracts hundreds of millions of television viewers worldwide, as well as tens of thousands of delighted and enthralled spectators inside the Olympic stadium. 
It is also – first and foremost – a majestic show, through which each host nation exhibits its culture, history, achievements and, often, its sense of humour.

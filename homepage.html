The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world
participate in a variety of competitions.The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.The Olympic Games are held 
every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were 
held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894,leading to the first modern
Games in Athens in 1896.The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National 
Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, 
bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame.The 
Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.

The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia,Greece. Competition was among representatives of several 
city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece.These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has
been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as 
the Olympic peace or truce.This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were travelling to Olympia to pass 
through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus.The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend; one of the most popular myths identifies 
Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games.According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games "Olympic" and established the custom of holding them every 
four years.The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, pankration,
and equestrian events.The Olympic Games reached their zenith in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in 
Greece.While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393 AD.

The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organisations and federations, recognised media partners, as well as athletes, officials,judges, 
and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter.  As the umbrella organisation of the Olympic Movement, the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the sports program, and negotiating sponsorship and 
broadcasting rights.</p>
<p>The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements:
<ul type="disc">
<li>International Federations (IFs) are the governing bodies that supervise a sport at an international level. For example, the International Federation of Association Football(FIFA
is the IF for association football, and the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball is the international governing body for volleyball. There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic 
Movement, representing each of the Olympic sports.
<li>National Olympic Committees (NOCs) represent and regulate the Olympic Movement within each country.For example,the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) is the NOC of the Russian Federation. 
There are currently 205 NOCs recognised by the IOC.
<li>Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) are temporary committees responsible for the organisation of each Olympic Games. OCOGs are dissolved after each Games once the 
final report is delivered to the IOC.

The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, better known as the Olympic rings, consists of five intertwined rings 
and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents (Africa, America, Asia, Australia and Europe). The coloured version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a 
white field forms the Olympic flag. These colours were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first
time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.The Olympic motto, Citius, Altius, Fortius, a Latin 
expression meaning "Faster, Higher, Stronger" was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin in 1894 and has been official since 1924. The motto was coined by Coubertin's friend, the Dominican
priest Henri Didon OP, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891.The Olympic mascot,an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in 1968. 
The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire. Much Wenlock still hosts the Wenlock Olympian Games, which were an 
inspiration to Pierre de Coubertin for the Olympic Games.

As mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred.Most of these rituals 
were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically starts with the entrance of the president of the host country followed by the hoisting of the host 
country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture. The 
artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening 
ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100 million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade 
into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter in order to honour the origins of the Olympics.

<p align="justify">
The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the 
athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of the current host 
country; the flag of Greece, to honour the birthplace of the Olympic Games; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. The president of the 
organising committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished.The next host nation then also briefly
introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of its culture.As is customary, the last medal presentation of the Games is held as part of the closing 
ceremony. Typically, the marathon medals are presented at the Summer Olympics, while the cross-country skiing mass start medals are awarded at the Winter Olympics.

A medal ceremony is held after each Olympic event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their 
respective medals. After the medals are given out by an IOC member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist's country
plays. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers. While in the
Summer Olympics this ceremony is held on the ground where the event is played, in the Winter Games it is usually held in a special "plaza".
